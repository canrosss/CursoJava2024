## What is a Variable in Java?
This chapter describes how to write a variable in Java, but first lets explain what is a variable.
In simple terms, a variable is a memory space which store values like numbers, words and operators. 

Lets think in a variable like a "container" which stores data

Since Java is type strict we can "**declare**" a diferent type of containers or variables to store data basic like
- *Numbers
	- Decimal, float
- Text
	- Characters
	- String

## So how to define a Variable to be use Java?

Variable is a name location in memory that stores a value. The value may contain numbers, text, images, sounds, and others types of data.
To store a value , you first have to declare a variable.

```java
String message;
```

The statement is called "**declaration**" because this is used to declare a variable message using the type "**String**" 
The type is used to define the values that can store.

To declare integer numbers the "**declaration**" can be like
```java
int number;
```

**Note**: Each **declaration statement ends with semicolon** (;)

Assignation example
```java
int a = 5;  // assignation of 5 value integer to variable a
int b = 6;  // assignation of 6 value integer to variable b
a = 3;    // now  value 3 is assigned to a and overwrites the 5 original value.
```

### Name Convention
The variable name usually begins with lowercase letters in contrast to class names, the class name starts with capitalize like "**Hello**" 
When a variable name con- tains more than one word (like ***firstName***), it is conventional to capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. 
Variable names are case-sensitive, so firstName is not the same as firstname or FirstName.

### Reserved Keywords
You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about 50 reserved words, called keywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names. These words include public, class, static, void, and int, which are used by the compiler to analyze the structure of the program.

You can see the full list of keywords at https://thinkjava.org/keywords, but you don’t have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide “syntax highlighting”, which makes different parts of the program appear in different colors. And the compiler will complain even if one does sneak past you and your editor.

**Constants**
A variable which the value doesn't change during execution time is called "constant" to declare a constant we need to add the following  reserved word
```java
final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
```

Declaring that a variable is **final** means it cannot be reassigned once it has been initialized. If you try, the compiler gives an error.
By convention, a **constant** name are all uppercase, with the underscore character (_ ) between words.
