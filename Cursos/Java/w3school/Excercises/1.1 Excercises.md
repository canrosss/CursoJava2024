## Compile Testing
### Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program. Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section 1.3.

1. Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the “Hello, World!”. Say something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the program again.

```java
package com.canrossoft.radar;  
  
public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        //Excercise 1.1  
        System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");  
        System.out.printf("How are you?");  
    }  
}
```

### Syntax
Programming requires to follow convetions and syntaxis, what happend if the syntax is wrong?
