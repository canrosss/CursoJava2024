## Syntax Testing

It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces. Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it. But sometimes the error messages are misleading. Over time you will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things out yourself.

### Exercise 1.3 

Starting with the hello world program, try out each of the following errors. After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), and then fix the error.

1. Remove one of the open curly braces. 
2. Remove one of the close curly braces.
3. Instead of main, write mian.  
4. Remove the word static
5. Remove the word public.  
6. Remove the word System.  
7. Replace println with Println. 8. Replace println with print. 9. Delete one of the parentheses.
8. Add an extra parenthesis.

```java
package com.canrossoft.radar;  
  
public class Main {  
    public static void mian(String[] args) {  
        //Excercise 1.1  
        System.out.print("Hello and welcome!");  
        System.out.printf"How are you?");  
    
}
```

### Missing elements in the code produce errors when compiling
