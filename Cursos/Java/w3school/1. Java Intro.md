## What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
It is owned by Oracle, and more than **3 billion** devices run Java.

It is used for:
- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
- And much, much more!

## Why Use Java?

- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) and [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp), it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

## What are the Features of the JVM?

The Java Virtual Machine has several key features that make it such a powerful and invaluable platform including platform independence, memory management, security, dynamic loading, JIT compilation, and multithreading:

- Platform independence: The JVM includes a platform-independent runtime environment which allows for the execution of Java applications on most hardware and software architectures.
- Memory management: The JVM manages memory automatically vis its built-in garbage collector, which frees up memory when the program is finished with it, saving the developer from having to account for memory allocation and deallocation.
- Security: The JVM enforces security policies to prevent malicious code from gaining access to system resources.
- Dynamic loading: With the Java Virtual Machine, classes are dynamically loaded at runtime, making it so developers can extend the functionality of their Java programs without the need for recompilation or redeployment.
- Just-In-Time compilation: JIT compilation improves application performance by compiling frequently executed bytecode into native machine language.
- Multithreading: The JVM supports multithreading, which lets Java programs run multiple threads of execution at the same time.
